==========

This is a mashup of [domino.js](http://dominojs.org/) and [sigma.js](http://sigmajs.org/) using the [themoviedb.org](http://www.themoviedb.org/) [API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/).

If you want to try it, you need to ask for an API key, then fill in your key in `scripts/config.js`.

I'll possibly ask them for a public API later, when this mashup will reach a more complete state.
